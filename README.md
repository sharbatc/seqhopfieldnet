# Sequential Hopfield Network
A Hopfield network is a recurrent artificial neural network capable of storing patterns (e.g. pictures) implicitly in the weights of the network. It is a well established model for so called content-addressable associative memory. 

In this project, we will study a variation of a Hopfield network which stores sequences of patterns. This network, once initialised, will reproduce a learned trajectory of states. We can think of this as a model for complex behaviours such as arm movements.
